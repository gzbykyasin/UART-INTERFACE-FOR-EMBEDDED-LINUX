# UART INTERFACE Example for Embedded Linux
## Abstract
*Set your serial path according to the SOM or SOC you use. You can learn your serial path as follows. <br/>
```bash
ls -la /dev/tty*
```
Good luck to everyone.  <br/>
Then enter your own serial path instead of "NAME" in the code. <br/>
Wash your hands abundantly during these times of virus and code them clean :blush:
